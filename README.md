This project was boostrapped using Create-React-App. 
This project's stock information was provided by [IEX Finance API](https://iextrading.com/developer/docs/#stocks).

### The following is a friendly documentation of the capabilities of the application:
- Search for stock information given a ticker or name.
- Analyze a given stock for expected yearly returns (DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE RESULTS CALCULATED WILL HAPPEN)
- Allow the user to create an account to keep track of past reports and allow them to print these reports.

## HOW TO USE THE STOCK ANALYSIS TOOL:
1) Click the link in the description of this repository to use the up-to-date version of the application.
2) Start by naming your portfolio and adding some helpful comments to remind you what type of stocks that portfolio is supposed to hold
3) Switch to the stock adder portion of the application by clicking the list icon in the top left of the portfolio manager (next to the Portfolio list)
4) Add you stock information by providing a valid stock ticker, number of shares you have (or will purchase) and the expected annual growth rate of the company (can be found on NASDAQ.com or another similar stock reporting site)
        - IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT GAURANTEE RETURNS OF ANY AMOUNT
5) Should you want to change the name/comments on a portfolio, simply click the edit portfolio button found directly next to the add stock button
6) You can delete portoflios by clicking the trash icon in the portfolio list for a specific portfolio. Similarly, you can delete a stock from the portfolio on the add stock screen for a portfolio by hitting the trash icon.
7) You can also add a new portfolio with the plus icon directly next to the edit portfolio button
8) Should you have multiple portfolios, add stocks to each, you can click the "Analyze all Portfolios" button at the bottom of the Portfolio list to analyze all the portfolios in one click rather than analyzing them individually!
